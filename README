A general project exploring programming various physical properties. Features so far:

-  A GUI window that renders the scene. Supports moving aroung the viewport with WASD
   and zooming in and out by scrolling the mouse.

-  Objects can be placed in the scene. Objects have mass, charge, and other physical properties

-  Objects can attract or repel each other based on their charge

-  Objects can gravitate toward each other based on their mass

-  Objects can be accelerated downward to simulate gravity

-  Objects can be atttached to one another by springs, which obey Hooke's law

-  Rendering and updating use separate timing and are run in separate threads, as is the GUI.
